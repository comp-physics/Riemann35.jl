    setup_mpi_cartesian_3d(Nx::Int, Ny::Int, Nz::Int, halo::Int, comm::MPI.Comm)

Create a 2D Cartesian domain decomposition over MPI ranks (no z decomposition).

# Arguments
- `Nx`: Global grid size along x direction
- `Ny`: Global grid size along y direction
- `Nz`: Global grid size along z (no decomposition, all ranks have full z)
- `halo`: Halo width in cells (typically 2)
- `comm`: MPI communicator

# Returns
A named tuple with fields:
- `nx_global`: Global grid size in x
- `ny_global`: Global grid size in y
- `nz_global`: Global grid size in z
- `halo`: Halo width
- `dims`: (Px, Py, 1) process grid dimensions (Pz=1, no z decomposition)
- `coords`: (rx, ry, 0) coordinates of this rank in process grid (0-based)
- `rank`: This rank index (0-based)
- `neighbors`: Named tuple with fields left, right, down, up (rank indices or -1)
- `local_size`: (nx_local, ny_local, nz) interior size (without halos)
- `istart_iend`: (i0, i1) global inclusive interior index range for x
- `jstart_jend`: (j0, j1) global inclusive interior index range for y
- `kstart_kend`: (1, nz) global inclusive interior index range for z (always full)

# Notes
- Uses an approximately square process grid (Px, Py, 1) with Px*Py=nprocs
- Uses block decomposition in x and y with remainder cells assigned to lower coords
- No decomposition in z: all ranks have the full z-dimension (Pz=1)

# Example
```julia
decomp = setup_mpi_cartesian_3d(40, 40, 4, 2, MPI.COMM_WORLD)
# For 4 ranks: creates 2x2x1 process grid
# Each rank gets 20x20x4 interior cells
```
